Runtime Environment
===================

A Python to Rubinius-bytecode would be pretty much useless without a
way of running that as a valid Python program. To this end, Typhon
provides a full Python runtime environment, that is, core modules,
builtin function, everything you need to run your Python program on
Rubinius.

# TODO: document how python object model is implemented in Typhon.
# Add links to design/algorithm docs if needed.
